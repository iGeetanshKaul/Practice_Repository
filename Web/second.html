                In the annals of space exploration, the Apollo 12 mission stands as a testament to human ingenuity, resilience, and
                precision. Launched on November 14, 1969, Apollo 12 was the sixth crewed mission in the Apollo program and the second to
                successfully touch down on the lunar surface. Led by Commander Charles "Pete" Conrad, with Alan L. Bean as the lunar
                module pilot and Richard F. Gordon as the command module pilot, the mission overcame unexpected challenges to achieve
                historic success.
